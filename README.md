**RNN** stands for **Recurrent Neural Network**, which is a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or spoken words. Unlike a traditional neural network, which processes inputs independently, an RNN can use its internal state (memory) to process a sequence of inputs, which allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

The term "recurrent" comes from the loops in the network, which create a 'recurrence' in the network's operation, effectively forming a connection in time. This makes them exceptionally useful for tasks where context from earlier inputs is required to understand later ones, like language processing.

However, RNNs have a problem known as "vanishing gradient" where they lose information over time. This makes it difficult for them to understand long-term dependencies, meaning they struggle to link related events in a sequence if there are non-related events in between. This has led to the creation of improved types of RNNs such as Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which can remember information for longer periods of time.

RNNs have a broad array of applications, including:

Language modeling and generating text
Machine translation
Speech recognition
Time series prediction
Sentiment analysis



**How it works?**


The following scripts use  **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model**, specifically a type of RNN called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to predict lottery numbers.

The script works as follows:

Data loading and preprocessing: The script loads lottery numbers data from an Excel file. The data consists of lottery numbers that have been won in the past, with each row in the Excel file containing three numbers. The data is then normalized to a range of 0 to 1, a common practice in machine learning to make sure different features have similar scales.

Prepare data for LSTM: The LSTM model expects the input to be in a 3D shape. It creates a sequence of the previous seven sets of numbers (window_length=7) to predict the next set.

Define LSTM model: The model is defined using the Keras API. It is a deep network with multiple layers of LSTM units. The Bidirectional wrapper is used, which allows the network to have forward and backward connections. This is followed by a Dropout layer for regularization (to prevent overfitting), and it repeats this structure several times. Finally, the model has a dense (fully connected) layer that maps the LSTM outputs to the final prediction.

Compile and train model: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function (common for regression problems). The model is then trained on the data, using a validation split of 20% (which means 20% of the data is set aside for validating the model's performance). It also utilizes a model checkpoint mechanism to save the best model (in terms of validation loss) during training, and early stopping to prevent unnecessary training time if the model stops improving.

Prediction: The model is used to predict the next set of lottery numbers based on the most recent actual numbers.

Evaluation: Finally, it prints out the predicted numbers, and the actual numbers in the last lottery game for comparison.

While this is an interesting exercise, it's important to note that lottery numbers are typically drawn in a random manner, and the past drawings don't necessarily influence the future ones, thus it's highly unlikely that this method could predict future lottery numbers with high accuracy.
